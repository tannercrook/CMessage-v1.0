CMESSAGE


A User Guide



Getting Started.

CMessage is an application built to help users share and store their code securely. Friends, colleagues and groups will now be able to effectively collaborate and store code with ease.

To get started, simply open the application and on the top menu select:

			Connection > Connect

A window will appear prompting the user to input some information. Address is the address
of the FTP server you are using (If you do not know your FTP address contact your server
administrator). Enter your correct username and password.

Now you will be able to write in the screen and publish to your server! When you are ready to 
do so simply press the Publish button at the bottom of the application screen. It will prompt 
you to enter an encryption key if you have not already done so. Enter the password you wish
to use to encrypt your information. After you have entered the key, the application will push the information to the server and notify you of a successful upload.

If you wish to set a different key, from the top menu select:

			Connection > Set Key

This will prompt the users for a key and will set the encrypt and decrypt key.

Troubleshooting.

Common Errors:

	File wonâ€™t upload - Check FTP information.
	Decryption Error - Make sure you have the correct password to decrypt.
